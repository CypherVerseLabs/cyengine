1. Cypher Reality
The CypherReality component is a top-level wrapper for a 3D scene. It includes multiple layers and handles different aspects of the virtual environment, such as the environment, physics, player control, toolbelt, and network. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

tsx

Copy code

<CypherReality
    environmentProps={{...}} // settings for the environment layer
    physicsProps={{...}} // settings for the physics layer
    playerProps={{...}} // settings for player movement and control
    networkProps={{...}} // settings for multiplayer network features
    disableGround={true} // disables the default infinite ground plane
/>

Environment Layer: Controls the overall environment, such as setting up a background, pause menu, or custom loading screens.
Physics Layer: Integrates physics into the 3D world, using react-three/cannon for real-time physics.
Player Layer: Manages the player's position, movement speed, and controls (supports VR, desktop, and mobile).
Toolbelt Layer: Offers a set of user tools for interacting with the world, such as a camera or walkie-talkie.
Network Layer: Manages multiplayer, including signaling, peer-to-peer connections, and voice chat.
2. Environment Layer
This layer abstracts the 3D DOM and is where the scene's main configuration happens. You can customize various environment aspects like background colors, fog, and more.

tsx
Copy code
<Background color="blue" />
<Fog color="white" near={10} far={100} />
<InfinitePlane size={[100, 100]} visible={false} />
3. Player Layer
The PlayerLayer provides player controls and manages how the player interacts with the world. Players can move in the world, and their position is updated in real-time.

tsx
Copy code
<PlayerProps pos={[0, 0, 0]} speed={1} />
4. Toolbelt Layer
This layer provides tools for the user to interact with the world. For example, the Camera Tool allows the player to take pictures, while the Walkie Talkie Tool manages voice communication.

tsx
Copy code
<Camera />
<WalkieTalkie />
5. Network Layer
The network layer manages multiplayer interactions by offering features like automatic peer-to-peer connection establishment, voice chat, and data channels for communication between players.

tsx
Copy code
<NetworkProps autoconnect={true} voice={true} />
6. Tools
Tools are interactive elements that can be added to the toolbelt. Examples include the Camera Tool, Walkie Talkie Tool, and any custom tools you may want to create for interactions in the 3D world.

tsx
Copy code
<Tool name="Camera" pos={[0, 0]} />

7. Modifiers and Effects
Modifiers like Spinning, Floating, and LookAtPlayer provide dynamic behaviors to objects in the scene. You can animate objects, make them float, spin, or always face the player.

tsx
Copy code
<Spinning xSpeed={1} ySpeed={0} zSpeed={0} />
<Floating height={0.5} speed={1} />
<LookAtPlayer enabled={true} />

8. Media Layer
This layer handles media like images, videos, and audio within the 3D world. You can add 3D media assets to your scene for richer experiences.

tsx
Copy code
<Image src="https://link-to-your-image.png" size={1} framed />
<Video src="https://link-to-your-video.mp4" volume={1} />
<Audio url="https://link-to-your-audio.mp3" position={[0, 4, 0]} />

9. UI Components
There are various UI components like buttons, switches, text inputs, and key press events for user interaction. These are helpful for building menus, control panels, or interactive guides within the scene.

tsx
Copy code
<Button onClick={() => console.log("Clicked!")}>Click Me</Button>
<Switch value={false} onChange={(val) => console.log(val)} />
<TextInput value="Hello" onChange={(val) => console.log(val)} />
10. Interactive Elements
You can make objects in the 3D world interactive. For example, you can add onClick and onHover callbacks, or even use Anchor to create clickable links within the 3D space.

tsx
Copy code
<Interactable onClick={() => console.log("Clicked!")} />
<Anchor href="https://example.com">Go to Website</Anchor>
This system allows developers to quickly create complex interactive 3D experiences with minimal setup, thanks to reusable components for physics, media, player interaction, and multiplayer networking.
